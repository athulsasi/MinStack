# MinStack
Here I've implemented solution for the below "min stack" question using std::vector as 
a simple console application. All the operations work with a time complexity O(1).
It has been successfully tested for operations like push, pop, top, min etc.
(the test results are displayed on the console).

[Question]
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
